# BinaryMapVizualizer
# Problem:
Input is a file with the binary map where rows and columns in a file are coordinates.
Space " " means unoccupied, Character "x" means occupied. Everything after character "#" including this character is a comment. No other character before "#" than space or "x" is allowed.

Your program should load the file, validate it, visualize the binary map and count the number of connected occupied area. Connected means neighboring in a row or in a column.

Validation and counting should be in separated DLL next to GUI executable.

Examples of input files are inside solution
